# Securin-assessment

Part A)
1. How many total combinations are possible? 
2. Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations that can be obtained when rolling both Die A and Die B together. 
3. Calculate the Probability of all Possible Sums occurring among the number of combinations from (2).

Part B)

● Die A cannot have more than 4 Spots on a face.

● Die A may have multiple faces with the same number of spots.
● Die B can have as many spots on a face as necessary i.e. even more than 6.

But in order to play your game, the probability of obtaining the Sums must remain the
same! So if you could only roll P(Sum = 2) = 1/X, the new dice must have the spots reattached
such that those probabilities are not changed.
